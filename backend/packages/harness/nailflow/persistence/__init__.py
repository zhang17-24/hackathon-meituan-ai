"""nailflow application persistence layer (SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM).

This module manages nailflow's own application data -- runs metadata,
thread ownership, cron jobs, users. It is completely separate from
LangGraph's checkpointer, which manages graph execution state.

Usage:
    from nailflow.persistence import init_engine, close_engine, get_session_factory
